With a strong academic and research foundation from IIT Gandhinagar and real-world experience building scalable AI systems for clients from New Zealand, Germany and USA, I bring both technical depth and a drive to solve meaningful problems.\nOver the past few years, Iâ€™ve been deeply immersed in the world of Generative AIâ€”exploring how large language models can move beyond demos and into production-grade systems. Iâ€™m passionate about bridging innovation and utility: making complex systems accessible, efficient, and useful for real users. While I havenâ€™t contributed much to open source yet, Iâ€™ve built internal platforms that are modular, reusable, and open-source in spirit. Given the opportunity, Iâ€™m confident I can bring that same level of clarity and impact to public projectsâ€”and Iâ€™m eager to grow while doing it.\nWhat sets me apart is my relentless curiosity. I actively follow new research, experiment with state-of-the-art models, and stay up to date with the latest in computer hardware, GPUs, and AI infrastructure to ensure my solutions are both forward-looking and efficient. I also have three papers under my belt. Outside of tech, I draw inspiration from anime and mangaâ€”especially series like One Piece and Haikyu!!â€”which remind me of the importance of perseverance, teamwork, and dreaming big.\nAll I ask for is a chance to prove myself. I bring with me not just technical skills, but a growth mindset, adaptability, and a genuine passion for building whatâ€™s next. Iâ€™d love to contribute to your team and help shape the future together.\nThank you for considering my application.\nBest regards, Sudip Das\n"}]
