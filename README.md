## Content Management

- All main content is in the `content/` directory, organized in Markdown files.
- The sidebar menu is generated from the `content/docs/` section.

- Front matter in each Markdown file controls title, menu order, ToC, etc.

Example front matter:
```toml

title = "Showcase"
weight = 10
bookToC = true

```
