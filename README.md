Other directories:
- `exampleSite/` - Example content and configuration (not used in production)
- `public/`, `resources/` - Generated by Hugo during build

---

## Prerequisites

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) **extended version** (v0.146 or higher)
  - Check your version with: `hugo version`
  - The extended version is required for SCSS/SASS processing

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sudip-das-0/Portfolio.git
   cd Portfolio
   ```

2. **Install Hugo (if not already):**
   - [Installation Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

3. **Run the local development server:**
   ```sh
   hugo server --minify
   ```
   - The site will be available at [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)

4. **Build the static site:**
   ```sh
   hugo --minify
   ```
   - Output will be in the `public/` directory

---

## Content Management

- All main content is in the `content/` directory, organized in Markdown files.
- The sidebar menu is generated from the `content/docs/` section.
- To add or edit documentation, create or modify Markdown files in `content/docs/`.
- Front matter in each Markdown file controls title, menu order, ToC, etc.

Example front matter:
```toml
---
title = "Showcase"
weight = 10
bookToC = true
---
```

---

## Theme Customization

This site uses the [hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme as a Hugo module.

- **Configuration:** See `hugo.toml` for theme parameters (color theme, ToC, favicon, etc.)
- **Custom styles:** Add/override SCSS in `themes/hugo-book/assets/_custom.scss`
- **Static assets:** Place custom files in `static/`
- **Shortcodes:** Use built-in shortcodes for buttons, columns, details, hints, KaTeX, Mermaid, tabs, etc.
- **Menu:** Controlled by the `BookSection` parameter and front matter in docs

For full theme documentation and advanced customization, see the [hugo-book README](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book#readme).

## Deployment

**Important:** GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default, which is not compatible with Hugo sites.  
To deploy a Hugo site, you must build the site and publish the contents of the `public/` directory.  
A `.nojekyll` file is included to disable Jekyll processing.

### Manual Deployment

For project sites (e.g., github.com/username/repo), GitHub Pages serves from the `/docs` folder on the `master` or `main` branch by default.

1. Build the site:
   ```sh
   hugo --minify
   ```
2. Copy the contents of the `public/` directory (including `.nojekyll`) into a `/docs` folder at the root of your repository:
   ```sh
   rm -rf docs
   cp -r public docs
   ```
3. Commit and push the `/docs` folder to the `master` branch:
   ```sh
   git add docs
   git commit -m "Deploy site to docs folder"
   git push
   ```
4. In your repository settings, ensure GitHub Pages is set to serve from the `/docs` folder on the `master` branch.

After a few minutes, your site should be live at the URL provided by GitHub Pages.

If you prefer to use a `gh-pages` branch, push the contents of `public/` to that branch and configure GitHub Pages accordingly.

### GitHub Actions Deployment

You can automate deployment with GitHub Actions.  
Below is a sample workflow (`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`):

```yaml
name: Deploy Hugo site to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # or your default branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: true  # Fetch Hugo themes (if any)
      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v3
        with:
          hugo-version: 'latest'
          extended: true
      - name: Build
        run: hugo --minify
      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
          # Ensure .nojekyll is included
```
