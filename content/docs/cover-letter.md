# Cover Letter

Holla Companion!

I'm excited to apply for opportunities in Machine Learning with a specialisation of NLP and GenAI. With a strong academic and research foundation from IIT Gandhinagar and real-world experience building scalable AI systems for clients from Newzealand, Germany and USA, I bring both technical depth and a drive to solve meaningful problems.

Over the past few years, I’ve been deeply immersed in the world of Generative AI—exploring how large language models can move beyond demos and into production-grade systems. I’m passionate about bridging innovation and utility: making complex systems accessible, efficient, and useful for real users. 
While I haven’t contributed much to open source yet, I’ve built internal platforms that are modular, reusable, and open-source in spirit. Given the opportunity, I’m confident I can bring that same level of clarity and impact to public projects—and I’m eager to grow while doing it.

What sets me apart is my relentless curiosity. I actively follow new research, experiment with state-of-the-art models, and stay up to date with the latest in computer hardware, GPUs, and AI infrastructure to ensure my solutions are both forward-looking and efficient. I also have three papers under my belt. Outside of tech, I draw inspiration from anime and manga—especially series like One Piece and Haikyu!!—which remind me of the importance of perseverance, teamwork, and dreaming big.

All I ask for is a chance to prove myself. I bring with me not just technical skills, but a growth mindset, adaptability, and a genuine passion for building what’s next. I’d love to contribute to your team and help shape the future together.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards, \
Sudip Das
