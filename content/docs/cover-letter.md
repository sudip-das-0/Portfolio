# Cover Letter

Dear Recruiter,

I am excited to apply for opportunities in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. With a strong academic foundation from IIT Gandhinagar and hands-on experience building scalable AI systems for global clients, I thrive at the intersection of research and real-world impact. My expertise spans LLMs, NLP, computer vision, and MLOps, and I have a proven track record of delivering innovative solutions in legal tech, document automation, and knowledge management.

What sets me apart is my passion for continuous learning and my drive to stay at the forefront of technology. I regularly read the latest research papers and experiment with state-of-the-art models, always seeking new ways to push the boundaries of what's possible. My curiosity extends beyond codeâ€”I am a tech enthusiast who follows the latest in computer hardware, GPUs, and AI infrastructure, ensuring that my solutions are both cutting-edge and efficient.

Outside of work, I find inspiration in anime and manga, especially series like One Piece and Haikyu, which fuel my creativity and remind me of the value of perseverance, teamwork, and adventure. I believe that a great engineer is not just defined by technical skills, but by a growth mindset, adaptability, and a genuine passion for building the future.

I am eager to bring my skills, curiosity, and energy to your team, and to contribute to projects that make a real difference. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Sudip Das
